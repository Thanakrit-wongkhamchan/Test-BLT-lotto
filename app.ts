/*Create Basic Lotto Service following this requirement

This Basic Lotto Service implements a simple lottery system where users can buy lotto tickets and win based on the drawn result. The lotto service allows users to select the number of digits (from 1 to 6 digits) they wish to bet on, and the system calculates the winnings based on how many digits match the last digits of the randomly drawn 6-digit result. The service should support the purchase of multiple tickets with different numbers and amounts, and users can choose to buy random numbers based on their selected digit length. Additionally, users can specify fixed digits for specific positions in the generated random numbers. The system should also allow users to set the draw result, check winning tickets, and return the corresponding prize based on matching digits.
